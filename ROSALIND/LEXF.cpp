ROSALIND EXERCISE
ID: LEXP

Given: A collection of at most 10 symbols defining an ordered alphabet, and a positive integer n (nâ‰¤10).

Return: All strings of length n that can be formed from the alphabet, ordered lexicographically.

Example output:

AA
AC
AG
AT
CA
CC
CG
CT
GA
GC
GG
GT
TA
TC
TG
TT


This exercise asks us to select all k-size subset of the A-size alphabet and return them lexicographically sorted.

What is the expected number of outputs? :: This relates to alphabet size A and k-mer size k, by k^(A).

Approach 1 :: Recursive Solution

    The first idea that comes to mind is to implement a recursive solution of the general form:

    For each letter in the set, call the function kmer_recur(letter, k, set)
    where letter is the letter, k is the length of the wanted subsets and set is the set.

    kmer_recur performs the following ::
    
        if k > 1 then it calls itself len(set) times, passing the value:

            kmer_recur(concat(letter, set[i]), k-1, set)

        if k == 1 then it prints the now full k-length string:

            std::cout << letter

    
    It should be apparent from this, that as the recursion expands, each initial letter will be contenated with all possible
    combinations of the len(alphabet) remaining letters, to yield a length k string. Because we call the recursive function in the chronological/
    lexicographically sorted order of the original alphabet (in terms of parameter letter), the returned k-length subsets/strings will always
    be sorted accordingly.

    If we wanted to return the strings in reverse-lexicographical order, we could call the original function on a reversed copy of
    the alphabet string.

            k_mer_recur(str+alphabet[i], (k-1), alphabet);
        }
